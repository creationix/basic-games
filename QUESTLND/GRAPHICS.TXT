                              Graphics.Txt
                 For Graphics library by 1998 VirtuaSoft

          (All these except colorpalette only work in screen 13H)

Command line:
        QB /L GRAPHICS

Texture Mapping:
                This is a texture mapping routine, fully written in QB45,
        that textures quadrilaterals, not two triangles like pros do it, so
        I'm actually skipping a step.  This texturing routine is not fully
        operational, yet, so it has some restrictions in its uses:  A
        picture with the suffix .TXR is the default; and the picture must be
        a 40*40 BSAVEd image.
                (Note: The coordinates go clockwise from the top-left -
        assuming the picture is upright.)

        Syntax:
                TextureMap x1%, y1%, x2%, y2%, x3%, y3%, x4%, y4%, file$

Palette:
                This loads a color palette that was BSAVEd as a file with
        256 colors defined each as 8-bits red, 8-bits green, 8-bits blue,
        and 8-bits null.  The default file suffix is .PAL

        Syntax:
                ColorPalette file$

Negative:
                This negatives a section of the screen defined if the loaded
        palette is RPG.PAL.

        Syntax:
                Negative x1%, y1%, x2%, y2%

Font:
                This displays text on the screen without erasing the graphics
        beneath the text!  The text can also be in 8 different colors, and it
        can be placed at any screen coordinates!

        Syntax:
                Font x%, y%, text$, startcolor%, endcolor%

Antialias:
                This smooths the image on the screen with RPG.PAL.

        Syntax:
                Antialias x1%, y1%, x2%, y2%

Flip Horizontally:
                It flips a section of the screen horizontally.

        Syntax:
                Fliphoriz x1%, y1%, x2%, y2%

Flip Vertically:
                It flips a section of the screen vertically.

        Syntax:
                Flipvert x1%, y1%, x2%, y2%

Fade:
                It either darkens or brightens a section of the screen -
        a + value brightens; a - value darkens.

Grayscale:
                It removes the color from a section of the screen.

        Syntax:
                grayscale x1%, y1%, x2%, y2%


I hope you have enjoy this utility!
