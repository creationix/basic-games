do for you?
%Q 2
%1 Tell me about yourself.       BaseTalk
%2 That is all for now.          End
%L BaseTalk
I am the commander of this
base and we were attacked
by the Ur-Quan forces.
%P
It almost destroyed us.
%P
We were left for dead, but then
you came and beat the guard
obtaining the moon rock.
%P
We used it to fix the station and
are indebted to you.
%P
%G Enter
%L BaseI1
Thank you so much for
getting the Moon Rock.
%P
We are now putting it into the reactor.

Attention unidintified vesell.
We are in desperate need of help.
%P
Can you help us?
%Q 3
%1 Woa, who are you              Base2
%2 Sure, what do you need        Base3
%3 Why should I help you         Base4
%L Base3
Wait, why are you so
ambitious to help us?
%P
Don't you think it is not very
wise to help someone who was attacked
for an unknown crime?
%Q 3
%1 Why were you attacked?        Base5
%2 Who are you?                  Base2
%3 Why should I help you?        Base4
%L Base5
We were attacked because we broke
the slave laws of the master Ur-Quan.
%P
Their laws stated that it was illegal
to leave the base, even for our
own survival.
%P
We were desperate and left in search
minerals and other supplies.
%P
While we were gone they attacked and
destroyed most of the base.
%Q 1
%1 I will make them pay          Base6
%L Base2
I am the commander of this spacestation
and we were unfairly attacked by the
Ur-Quan slave masters.
%Q 1
%1 Why should I help you.        Base4
%L Base4
If you don't help us, you
won't have any way to repair or
improve your 'great' ship.
%Q 2
%1 Okay what do you need.        Base6
%2 Why do you need help.         Base5
%L Base6
Alright, here is the plan.
%P
IF you should accecpt this mission,
you will be sent down to fight...
%P


                The Rock!

%P
If you kill him, take the moon rock
and bring it back.
%P
Give it to us and we will use it
to repair the main reactor.
%Q 1
%1 I am ready to fight.          Base7

Nobody on your ship can decode the
messages.
%P
Now the messages are changing into
more friendly languages.
%P
Now it is Supox, now Airloo, WOE!!
It is in english.
%P
The message is telling you to turn off
the buffer on your ship, it is hurting
them.
%P
Do you turn the buffer off?
%Q 2
%1 Yes                           Eyoff
%2 That would meltdown the ship! Enoff
%L Enoff
Suddenly your buffer turns itself off
by some weird power.
%L Eyoff
As you turn the buffer wirls down your
ship starts the meltdown sequence.
%P
In a few short seconds your ship will
explode into mid space.
%P
That was the wrong move!

to select a ship. This is simple, just
pick one and press enter or space.
%P
The fighting is also simple,
The only controls are up, down, and
fire.
%P
The top of the screen shows how many
of your crew haven't been blown away by
the enemy blast.
%P
If your crew goes to zero, the ship
explodes and is gone forverer.
%P
If you defeat all the attacking ships,
you will have your normal crew
compliment restored.
%P
If all your ships are destroyed, then
you will lose the game.
%P
%E
%L MapHelp

takes a while to get good at.

down selecting items.
%P
When you first encounter the base, you
will have to save them. Then it will
be handed over to you for all use as
an all purpose store.
%P
To buy a part for your big ship, you
will have to go to the AddPart menu.
%P
If what you want is not there then go
to the next menu for more.
